Project-MUTBI
=============
Keep adding your ideas here :(also add what we might learn through the project in brackets)


1. *CHAT SERVICE*
   As decided , First we will work on the chat service , to make it more user friendly for a lay man. 
   The initial attempt would be to make it the best means for the students and teachers to interact ,not
   in an institution only , but the whole university .For eg. KMC people should interact with MITians 
   more frequently and thus help in making Manipal a better student town.The first target will be 10,000 
   students and staff of Manipal University and then the other Universities.
   (XMPP,FTP,)


2. *GUI for Shopkeepers*
    A nice and user-friendly GUI for the shopkeepers and Restraunts , that can help them improve 
    their billing system , keep track of their expenditure , manage employee accounts and much 
    more. We will provide them technical assistance as and when required . Start by selling the 
    Product locally and then go to bigger market .
   (data representation models)

3. *Expressions*
   Android app called 'expressions'.Which dosent send text messages sends personalised painted 
   postcards to the recipient.
   (Networking in Android)

4. *Manipal's Got Talent*
   No one can deny that a sizeable number of the MU students spend a major part of their time singing
   and recording songs(haha rajat).Lets aim to make a dedicated forum for them where they can share 
   their music.This may lead to increased artistic collaboration in MU.For self procalimed photographers
   to make their passion spread to a larger audience .It will be one and the only best platform 
   for the Manipalites to show and share and gradually we will start some online contest to Catch
   more attention and keep the fire burning . 
   (php,handling good amount of data at the server end)
good
    

5. *Manipal Mentors*
    A well designed Website , where we hace different catagories , where people can post their Questions 
    and we will engage some mentors with sound knowledge of the subject or topic to answer to the posts .
    For eg. For Computer Science , we can have our respected LUG seniors and a few Faculty members.For 
    gadgets we can find more , then for Bio and medical reltated questions , we can talk to people from 
    KMC . These are a very few to mention. It can be the best place for anyone to ask any question and 
    get a quick reply for their problem from people nearby. It will send text to the user's phone , when 
    they are answered.

6. *Track My Dues*
    A common topic of discussion in almost every student group is "DUES" to be paid. In MU , there
    is no means for the students to check their balance left in their FC or mess(apart from going to 
    the financial section), their hostel dues , their library dues etc. We can make it for the university
   . We know around 60 lakh was spent on ems system. This is something similar. A desktop application
   , android and ios application and a small website probably .
