Project-MUTBI
=============
Keep adding your ideas here :(also add what we might learn through the project in brackets)


1. *CHAT SERVICE*
   As decided , First we will work on the chat service , to make it more user friendly for a lay man. 
   The initial attempt would be to make it the best means for the students and teachers to interact ,not
   in an institution only , but the whole university .For eg. KMC people should interact with MITians 
   more frequently and thus help in making Manipal a better student town.The first target will be 10,000 
   students and staff of Manipal University and then the other Universities.
   (XMPP,FTP,)


2. *GUI for Shopkeepers*
    A nice and user-friendly GUI for the shopkeepers and Restraunts , that can help them improve 
    their billing system , keep track of their expenditure , manage employee accounts and much 
    more. We will provide them technical assistance as and when required . Start by selling the 
    Product locally and then go to bigger market .
   (data representation models)

3. *Expressions*
   Android app called 'expressions'.Which dosent send text messages sends personalised painted 
   postcards to the recipient.
   (Networking in Android)

4. *no name*
   No one can deny that a sizeable number of the MU students spend a major part of their time singing
   and recording songs(haha rajat).Lets aim to make a dedicated forum for them where they can share 
   their music.This may lead to increased artistic collaboration in MU.
